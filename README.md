# Ping_Pong_embedded_project

Some of the initialization have been completed by initializations of others groups.
It means that sometimes we were asking others groups how they had made their initialization functions for 
the differents components of the system, and we took some of theirs code lines (with changes) in order to complete 
our own initialization of the components because we were sometimes missing some information on how to initialize well the components.

This is code developped for the TTK4155 Industrielle og innbygde datasystemers konstruksjon course at NTNU Trondheim, Norway.
